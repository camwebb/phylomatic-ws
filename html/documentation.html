    <h3>Sending data with <code>curl</code></h3>
    <p>
      <code>curl</code> is a handy command line tool for interacting
      with websites.  You can send the data from a web-form back to
      the server from <code>curl</code>, if you know the
      parameters. The easiest way to use this to send data to
      phylomatic is first to create a text file (e.g.,
      <code>phylomatic.dat</code>) with the parameter data:
    </p>
    <pre>
      storedtree=R20120829&amp;informat=newick&amp;method=phylomatic&amp;
      taxaformat=slashpath&amp;outformat=newick&amp;
      taxa=acanthaceae%2Fbravaisia%2Fbravaisia_sp1%0D
      acanthaceae%2Fsuessenguthia%2Fsuessenguthia_sp1%0D
      ...
      %0D
    </pre>
    <p>
      Note that there should be no line-breaks in your input file. The
      whole thing should be one long string of text. The
      <code>%2F</code> and <code>%0D</code> symbols are URL-encoded
      slashes and newline characters, respectively.  Then just send
      the data to the server with:
    </p>
    <pre>
      $ curl -d @phylomatic.dat http://phylodiversity.net/phylomatic/pmws > output.new
    </pre>
    <p>
      (The <code>&gt; output.new</code> redirects the output to a
      file)
    </p>
    <h3>Too many taxa for this online version of phylomatic?</h3>
    <p>If you have more than about 5,000 taxa, a job on this server
    will take too long and the gateway will timeout. A limit of 5,000
    taxa has now been placed on a taxa file. You have two
    alternatives:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Use the desktop version of <tt>phylomatic</tt>, available
      with <tt>phylocom</tt>, or</li>
      <li>Use this (<tt>gawk</tt>-powered) version of
      <tt>phylomatic</tt> on your own computer:
      <ol>
        <li>Acquire the files from <a
        href="https://github.com/camwebb/phylomatic-ws">github</a>.</li>
        <li>Make sure the first line of the <tt>pmws</tt> file points
        to your <tt>gawk</tt> (version >= 4.0) executable.</li>
        <li>Run with (for example):</li>
      </ol>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <pre>
      $ echo "informat=newick&amp;storedtree=R20120829&amp;method=phylomatic&amp;taxauri=http://phylodiversity.net/phylomatic/eg/taxa_sample&amp;outformat=newick&amp;local=1" \
        | path/to/pmws > out.new
    </pre>
    <p>(Note the <tt>local=1</tt> switch!)</p>
    <h3>Too many taxa for this online version of phylomatic?
    (<b>Windows!</b>)</h3>
    <p>(2017-03-30) It seems people are needing to process more and
    more taxa, and the online phylomatic is insufficient for many
    users. Here is a more detailed HOWTO for running phylomatic
    locally on Windows. Please note, this solution is an ugly kludge
    (the software is written to work in a UNIX
    web-service framework, not a Windows desktop!), but it seems to work </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Visit <a
      href="https://github.com/camwebb/phylomatic-ws">github</a> and
      download the ZIP file for phylomatic (click on Clone or Download
      on the right). Unzip it somewhere.
      </li>
      <li>Get <tt>gawk</tt> (<b>version 4.0 or greater</b>) from <a
      href="http://www.klabaster.com/freeware.htm">here</a>, and
      <tt>cURL</tt> from <a
      href="https://curl.haxx.se/download.html">here</a> (choose Win32
      generic). Unzip the files and locate <tt>gawk.exe</tt> and
      <tt>curl.exe</tt> and copy them into the top directory of the
      phylomatic bundle, the same directory that has <tt>pmws</tt> in
      it.</li>
      <li>Create a plain text file with your commands in it. Use a
      plain text editor (Notepad++, or even just Notepad). Call it,
      e.g., <tt>commands.txt</tt>. Here is an example:
      <pre>
        informat=newick&amp;storedtree=R20120829&amp;method=phylomatic
        &amp;taxauri=http://phylodiversity.net/phylomatic/eg/taxa_sample
        &amp;outformat=newick&amp;local=1&amp;clean=true
      </pre>
      There should be no breaks in the string (unlike the example
      above).  What this command does is pass the same arguments from
      the <a href="../index.html">phylomatic web form</a> to the
      program, so see that page if you are unsure of the meaning of
      the arguments.
      </li>
      <li>Find the <b>Command Prompt</b> on you Windows system (e.g.,
      see <a
      href="https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-command-prompt-2618089">here</a>). Try
      searching for <tt>CMD.EXE</tt>. Open it, and navigate to the
      phylomatic directory, using <tt>CD</tt>.  To be sure you are
      there, type <tt>DIR</tt>, and you should see <tt>pmws</tt>,
      <tt>commands.txt</tt>, <tt>gawk.exe</tt> and <tt>curl.exe</tt>.
      </li>
      <li>Now to run phylomatic. Use the above <tt>commands.txt</tt> example first, to be sure your setup is working. In the Command Prompt, type:
      <pre>
        TYPE command.txt | gawk -f pmws
      </pre>
      You will see some errors ("Can't recognize...", etc.), but you should see a Newick tree appear at the bottom. Success!
      </li>
       <li>Once you are sure all is working, use the URL of your
       online taxa list (<tt>taxauri=http://...</tt>) and the URL of
       your framework tree (<tt>treeuri=</tt>) if not using a builtin
       tree. You should redirect the output to a file:
      <pre>
        TYPE command.txt | gawk -f pmws > mytree.new
      </pre>
      Hit Enter, and go have a cup of tea (or many!). Large taxa lists
       will take an hour or more to run. Hope this works for you.</li>
    </ol>

	  <li><b>PHYLOMATIC v2 IS NOW OFFLINE</b><a name="pm2hacked">
	  </a>(2013-01-10) The phylomatic v2 web-app was just hacked. I
	  could restore it, but in its current form, I would have to do
	  some significant rewriting to make it fully secure.  Since
	  developing the (more secure, I hope) <a
	  href="http://phylodiversity.net/phylomatic/">phylomatic version
	  3 web service</a>, I am not inclined to spend time on v2, and so
	  must depreciate it.  I am aware that some users have built
	  version 2 into scripts, and apologize in advance for any work
	  required to re-write script to utilize version 3; please blame
	  the hacker rather than me. If converting to version 3 will
	  present a significant problem for you, <em>please</em> do
	  contact me via email.<br/><br/>For reference only: version 2 <a
